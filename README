Development, Please:
+ use (free) StyleCop to hold up readability and quality of code. http://stylecop.codeplex.com/ 
  In combination with jetbrains R# http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/ it makes your life much easier.
+ document at least all visible parts of your code.
  Use of GhostDoc http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx is highly recommended.
+ program against the interface, not the implementation and help us to improve code:
  http://oreilly.com/catalog/pnetcomp2/chapter/ch03.pdf
+ add unit tests if you implement new functionality.
+ avoid Linq on speed critical parts.
+ avoid Linq with ".Any" statements always.
+ bear in mind that any release should run on multiple platforms.
  If you do not have a platform, ask us for help!
